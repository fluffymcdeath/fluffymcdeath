- 👋 Hi, I’m @fluffymcdeath
- 👀 I’m interested in the truth.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the truth.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on saving the world, and/or some time (which is equivalent to money apparently)
- 📫 How to reach me ...
You can look me up. Maybe tweet me. Or sign up at whyzzat.com I'm not doing much in the way of projects at the moment
but if you are in BC and have always wanted to join an Oddfellows lodge I might be able to hook you up.
